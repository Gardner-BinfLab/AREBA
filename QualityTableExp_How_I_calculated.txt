#Second column is experiment name.


#Third column shows core CDS are ON or OFF out of 1.
	This is how calculated this one. First I selected a core gene set which are "infC,nusA,pyrG,rpmA,rpsB,rpsE,rpsJ,rpsM,smpB".
	I used profile HMMs to find locations of these genes on genomes and then annotated them.
	I calculated the median depths of each annotation. However I wanted to normalize these medians, so I divided them to
	'depth per million', which means (TotalDepth/1000000). This metric is pretty consistent with normalizing using background.
	After calculating these normalized numbers, I set a treshold, which is 0.5, so if they pass 0.5, I say this gene is ON.
	Therefore, there are 10 genes for each species, if 6 out of 10 are ON it gets 0.6 score.
	However, archaea annotations are not that good, I could not train my HMMs for archaea gene location. Thus I used keyword
	"ribosomal" and official annotated locations to detect 10 most expressed genes and then same scoring like above.

#Fourth column shows ncRNA annotations are ON or OFF out of 1.
	It is similar to CDS ON or OFF test. This time I used core gene set "5S_rRNA,tmRNA,SSU_rRNA,small_SRP,large_SRP,RNaseP".
	The rest is similar.

#Fifth column shows strand correlation.
	It is pearson correlation coefficient between two strands. If data is stranded, it is very close to zero.
	If data is not stranded, correlation coefficient is greater than zero.
	
#Sixth coluwn shows correlation concordance.
	I have checked the top 100 most expressed genes and if their median are more than two times greater than the median under stranded
	assumption, it gets 1 point. After checking 100 genes, if data is stranded, it is close to 0 out of 100. If data is not stranded, it
	is close to 100 out of 100.
