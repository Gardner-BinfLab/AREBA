	There are two groups for ranking.
		
		# The first group contains RUFs, Rfam annotations, PfamA and PfamB annotations, thus these are ranked together.
		The files of first group are "PfamAB.ranking.PfamAB.txt, rfam.ranking.PfamAB.txt, ruf.ranking.PfamAB.txt".
		Each of them contains different type of annotations, and so each of them has different name.
		
		Each species directory contain files named *PfamAB.cumulative.stat which has the sorted expression data. I created those files and
		extracted required ranking information.
		
		# The second group contains RUFS, Rfam annotaions and CDS annotations of EMBL files, thus these are ranked together.
		The files of second group are "CDS.ranking.CDS.txt, rfam.ranking.CDS.txt, ruf.ranking.CDS.txt".
		Each of them contains different type of annotations, and so each of them has different name.
		
		Each species directory contain files named *CDS.cumulative.stat which has the sorted expression data. I created those files and
		extracted required ranking information.
