#First column is EMBL.

#Second column is experiment name.

#Third column is Pearson correlation coefficient.
	If it is closer to 0, it is stranded, otherwise not stranded.
	

#Fourth column shows core CDS are ON or OFF out of 1.
	First I selected core gene set from (Wu et al. 2013). The total number of genes are 40 and they are conserved both in archaea and bacteria.
	I used profile HMMs of Wu et al. 2013 to detect locations of these genes.
	I calculated the median depths of each location.
	I normalized these depths by dividing them to medians of 200 random locations.
	If this normalized median is larger than 1, it is expressed and ON.
	Therefore, if 39/40 are expressed according to a plot file, it gets 0.975.
	
#Fourth column shows ncRNA annotations are ON or OFF out of 1.
	It is similar to CDS ON or OFF test. This time I used core Rfam annotations (e.g 	'tRNA','RNaseP_bact_a','tmRNA','Bacteria_small_SRP','6S','SSU_rRNA_bacteria','5S_rRNA','C4','PK-G12rRNA').


#Sixth column shows concordance.
	This is tricky. I could not find an easy way to detect non-annotated highly expressed regions but I used a different method.
	First I found median depth of a plot file. So this is the background median of a plot file, all annotations have to pass this low treshold.
	Thus, for example, if 3600/4000 pass this treshold, it gets 0.9. I thought this metric, at least, shows concordance of annotations and plot files.
	
#Seventh column
	I will add coverage.
