#Strand_Correlation
/*	If it is closer to 0, it is stranded, otherwise not stranded.
	

#Core_CDS_On
/*	First I selected core gene set from Wu et al. 2013. The total number of genes are 40 and they are conserved both in archaea and bacteria.
/*	I used profile HMMs of Wu et al. 2013 to detect locations of these genes.
/*	I calculated the median depths of each annotation.
/*	I calculated the median of genome.
/*	If the median depth of annotation is equal or larger than genomic median, that gene is ON.
/*	Therefore, if 39/40 are expressed according to a plot file, it gets 0.975.
	
#Core_Rfam_On
/*	It is similar to CDS ON or OFF test. This time I used core Rfam annotations (e.g 	'tRNA','RNaseP_bact_a','tmRNA','Bacteria_small_SRP','6S','SSU_rRNA_bacteria','5S_rRNA','C4','PK-G12rRNA').


#PPV
/*	We are working on this. We implemented ROC plot based on various tresholds. Genomic median is DEFAULT.
/*	PPV=TP/(TP+FP)
/*	Concordance.py and Concordance_V2.py were created to implement algorithm.
/*		

#Specificity
/*	Spec=TN/(TN+FP)
/*	Concordance.py and Concordance_V2.py were created to implement algorithm. Genomic median is DEFAULT.

#Coverage

#Fraction_mapped_reads
